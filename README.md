# FLASH

## Overview

FLASH is a project aimed at facilitating learning through the use of flashcards and spaced learning techniques. This README provides a basic understanding of flashcards, spaced learning, and an overview of the FLASH project.

### Flashcards

Flashcards are a widely used educational tool designed to aid memorization and learning. They typically consist of a question or prompt on one side and the corresponding answer or information on the other side. By repeatedly reviewing flashcards, learners can reinforce their knowledge and improve retention.

### Spaced Learning

Spaced learning is a learning technique that involves spacing out review sessions over time to enhance long-term retention. Rather than cramming information all at once, spaced learning distributes study sessions across intervals, allowing the brain to better encode and store information.

## Features

The FLASH project offers the following features:

1. **Create Cards:** Users can create new flashcards by adding a question and its corresponding answer.
2. **Edit Cards:** Existing flashcards can be edited to update the question or answer as needed.
3. **Read Cards:** Users can review their flashcards, displaying the question side first followed by the answer side.
4. **Delete Cards:** Unwanted flashcards can be deleted from the collection.
